- **Real-time controls**: Pause/resume recording with hotkeys
- **Quality settings**: Configurable resolution, frame rate, and bitrate

### Video Editor
- **Timeline-based editing**: Multi-track timeline with visual waveforms
- **Preview window**: Real-time video preview with playback controls
- **Editing tools**:
  - Trim and cut functionality
  - Transition effects
  - Audio level adjustment
  - Track synchronization
- **Selection tools**: Easy editing zone selection
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Customizable hotkeys for all editing functions

### User Interface
- **Modern dark theme**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Rounded design elements**: Smooth, contemporary styling
- **Sharp icons**: High-quality, scalable vector icons
- **Micro-animations**: Subtle UI feedback and transitions
- **Responsive layout**: Adaptive interface for different screen sizes

### File Management
- **Custom output directory**: User-selectable default save location
- **Project management**: Save and load editing projects
- **Export options**: Multiple video formats and quality presets
- **Auto-save**: Automatic project backup during editing

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Recommended Framework: Electron + React

**Why Electron?**
- Cross-platform compatibility (Mac & Windows)
- Native OS integration for screen recording APIs
- Excellent auto-update system via `electron-updater`
- Access to system-level permissions and hardware
- Large ecosystem and community support

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (animations)
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg (via ffmpeg-static)
- **Screen Capture**: 
  - macOS: AVFoundation via native modules
  - Windows: Windows Media Foundation
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API + native audio capture
- **File System**: Node.js fs with electron-store for settings

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with accent colors (blue/purple gradients)
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif font (Inter or Poppins)
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system
- **Border Radius**: 8px-12px for cards, 4px-6px for buttons
- **Shadows**: Subtle drop shadows for depth

### Interaction Design
- **Hover states**: Smooth color transitions (200ms)
- **Button animations**: Scale and glow effects
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators
- **Feedback**: Toast notifications for user actions
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

### Recording
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`: Start/Stop recording
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`: Pause/Resume recording
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S`: Screenshot
- `Esc`: Cancel recording

### Editor
- `Space`: Play/Pause preview
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Z`: Undo
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Y`: Redo
- `Cmd/Ctrl + S`: Save project
- `Cmd/Ctrl + E`: Export video
- `Delete`: Delete selected clip
- `Cmd/Ctrl + X`: Cut selection
- `I`: Mark in point
- `O`: Mark out point
