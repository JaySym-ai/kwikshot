# Screen Recording Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the complete screen recording implementation for the KwikShot application. The implementation uses modern web APIs (`navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` and `MediaRecorder`) to provide professional-quality screen recording capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ScreenRecordingService** (`src/renderer/services/ScreenRecordingService.ts`)
   - Handles all screen capture and recording logic
   - Manages MediaRecorder and MediaStream instances
   - Provides error handling and capability detection

2. **Recording Store** (`src/renderer/stores/recordingStore.ts`)
   - Zustand-based state management for recording state
   - Manages recording settings, duration, and status
   - Handles error states and processing indicators

3. **UI Components**
   - **RecordingControls**: Start/stop/pause controls with visual feedback
   - **SourceSelector**: Screen and window source selection interface
   - **RecordingSettings**: Quality, frame rate, and audio configuration
   - **Recorder**: Main component that orchestrates all functionality

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Screen Capture Implementation
- **Display Media API**: Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` for screen capture
- **Browser Permissions**: Proper handling of user permission requests
- **Source Selection**: Users can choose specific screens or windows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for unsupported browsers or denied permissions
- **Capture Options**: Configurable video quality, frame rate, and audio inclusion

### ✅ UI Integration
- **Real-time Status**: Live recording duration timer with hours:minutes:seconds format
- **Visual Indicators**: Recording indicator with pulsing red dot animation
- **Control Buttons**: Start/stop/pause buttons with proper state management
- **Progress Feedback**: Processing indicators when starting/stopping recordings
- **Status Display**: Clear visual feedback for recording, paused, and ready states

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Multiple Audio Sources**: Support for system audio and microphone recording
- **Quality Settings**: 720p, 1080p, 1440p, and 4K recording options
- **Frame Rate Control**: 30fps and 60fps options
- **Pause/Resume**: Full pause and resume functionality during recording
- **Auto-switching**: Automatic transition to editor after recording completion

## Technical Implementation

### Screen Capture Process

1. **Capability Detection**
   ```typescript
   const capabilities = ScreenRecordingService.getCapabilities();
   // Checks for DisplayMedia and MediaRecorder support
   ```

2. **Media Stream Acquisition**
   ```typescript
   const mediaStream = await recordingService.getDisplayMedia(settings);
   // Gets screen/window stream with specified quality and audio settings
   ```

3. **Recording Setup**
   ```typescript
   await recordingService.startRecording(mediaStream, settings, callbacks);
   // Initializes MediaRecorder with optimal settings
   ```

### State Management

The recording state is managed through Zustand store with the following key states:
- `isRecording`: Whether recording is active
- `isPaused`: Whether recording is paused
- `isProcessing`: Whether starting/stopping recording
- `duration`: Current recording duration in seconds
- `settings`: Recording configuration (quality, audio, etc.)
- `error`: Any error messages to display

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling covers:
- Browser compatibility issues
- Permission denied scenarios
- No available sources
- MediaRecorder failures
- Stream interruptions

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Select Recording Source**
   - Choose from available screens or windows
   - Preview thumbnails help identify the correct source

2. **Configure Settings**
   - Select video quality (720p to 4K)
   - Choose frame rate (30fps or 60fps)
   - Enable/disable system audio and microphone

3. **Start Recording**
   - Click "Start Recording" button
   - Browser will prompt for screen sharing permission
   - Recording begins immediately after permission granted

4. **Control Recording**
   - Use pause/resume for breaks
   - Monitor duration with live timer
   - Stop recording when finished

5. **Access Recording**
   - Recording automatically opens in editor
   - Video blob is stored for editing/export

### For Developers

#### Adding New Features

1. **Extend Recording Settings**
   ```typescript
   // Add new setting to RecordingSettings interface
   interface RecordingSettings {
     // ... existing settings
     newSetting: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. **Modify Recording Service**
   ```typescript
   // Update getDisplayMedia method to handle new setting
   async getDisplayMedia(settings: RecordingSettings): Promise<MediaStream> {
     // ... handle new setting
   }
   ```

3. **Update UI Components**
   ```typescript
   // Add UI controls in RecordingSettings component
   ```

#### Testing

The implementation includes proper error boundaries and fallbacks:
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Clear error messages for users
- Automatic cleanup of resources

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- ✅ Chrome 72+
- ✅ Firefox 66+
- ✅ Safari 13+
- ✅ Edge 79+

### Required Permissions
- Screen recording permission
- Microphone access (if enabled)
- Secure context (HTTPS in production)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Efficient blob handling for large recordings
- Proper cleanup of MediaStream resources
- Optimized video bitrates based on quality settings
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management

### Recommended Settings
- **1080p @ 30fps**: Best balance of quality and file size
- **720p @ 30fps**: For longer recordings or slower systems
- **4K @ 60fps**: Only for high-end systems and short recordings

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Multiple Source Recording**: Record multiple screens simultaneously
2. **Webcam Overlay**: Picture-in-picture webcam recording
3. **Drawing Tools**: Real-time annotation during recording
4. **Streaming**: Live streaming capabilities
5. **Cloud Storage**: Direct upload to cloud services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Screen recording not supported"**: Update browser or use supported browser
2. **Permission denied**: Grant screen recording permission in browser settings
3. **No sources available**: Check system permissions for screen recording
4. **Recording fails to start**: Ensure secure context (HTTPS) in production
